# Minecraft themed shifumi

It's an old project from 2018 that I brought up to date. It's a very classic shifumi, but I really liked re-doing it under the Minecraft theme!

I used [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) and [particle.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) to help myself with the visuals.
